How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It shows the differences amng the files so its easy to identify the changes i.e. additions or 
deletions made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Can easily go back to any previous version which was working fine if we made some mistake in the current file.
